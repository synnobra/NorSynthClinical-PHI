# The NorSynthClinical PHI Corpus

**A corpus of clinical text which can be used as a reference standard for de-identification of Norwegian clinical text.** 


The reference standard corpus is synthetic and based on the NorSynthClinical corpus. NorSynthClinical is a synthetic corpus describing patients’ family history relating to cases of cardiac disease, presented and described here: https://github.com/ltgoslo/NorSynthClinical. 

To create this reference standard, the NorSynthClinical corpus was extended with personal information, and then, annotated using the following tags: 
* First_Name
* Last_Name
* Age
* Health_Care_Unit
* Phone_Number
* Social_Security_Number
* Date_Full
* Date_Part
* Location

The verified version of the reference standard is the "reference_standard_annotated.txt" file. 

The reference standard is made by Synnøve Bråten. It was made as a part of a master's thesis in the Joint Master's Programme in Health Informatics at Stockholm University/Karolinska Institutet. The master's thesis describing the work is available here: https://daisy.dsv.su.se/fil/visa?id=230054.
