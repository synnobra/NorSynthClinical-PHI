# Reference-standard-for-de-identification-of-Norwegian-clinical-text

**A corpus of clinical text which can be used as a reference standard for de-identification of Norwegian clinical text.** 


The reference standard corpus is synthetic and based on the NorSynthClinical corpus. The NorSynthClinical is a synthetic corpus describing patients’ family history relating to cases of cardiac disease, presented and described here: https://github.com/ltgoslo/NorSynthClinical. 

To create this reference standard, the NorSynthClinical corpus was extended with personal information, and then, annotated using the following tags: 
* First_Name
* Last_Name, Age
* Health_Care_Unit
* Phone_Number
* Social_Security_Number
* Date_Full, Date_Part
* Location
